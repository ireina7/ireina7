I plan to organize my github with this repo.

** About
The whole github repos can be categorized as the following *4* classes:
- /project/: Common projects for app production
- /study/: Study notes on some main project (mostly organized with =.md= or =.org= files)
- /note/: Pure notes for recording some infomation
- /playground/: A special project on playing some software (usually can be build or execute)
- /misc/: misc or forked
